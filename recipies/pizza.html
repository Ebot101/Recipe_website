        <p class="p" > Pizza is something that we all love to eat, it's a simple meal that combines cheese, bread, sauce, and some toppings if you have taste </p>
        <p class="p"> In my personal opinion, making Pizza isn't the hardest thing in the world to do</p>

        <h2> <strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
            <h3>Dough</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> 1 1/4 cups of warm water</li>
                <li> 1 teaspoon active dry yeast </li>
                <li> 3 cups bread flour </li>
                <li> 1 1/2 teaspoon fine salt </li>
                <li> 1/4 cup olive oil, divided</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Sauce</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> 1 28 ounce can of plain crushed tomatoes</li>
                <li> 1 14 ounce of pizza sauce (any kind works) </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Cheese</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>8 ounces of low-moisture whole-milk mozzarella, thinly sliced</li>
                <li> 1/4 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese  </li>
            </ul>
        <h2     > <strong>Recipie</strong></h2>
            <ol class="rec">
                <li>Combine water and yeast in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes. </li>
                <li>Combine flour and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Pour in yeast mixture. Knead dough until smooth, about 7 minutes.</li>
                <li>Grease a large bowl lightly with olive oil. Form dough into a tight ball and lightly grease the top. Place in the bowl; cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Mix crushed tomatoes and pizza sauce together in a bowl to make sauce.</li>
                <li>Grease a heavy-gauge rimmed 12x17-inch baking sheet generously with olive oil. Press dough into the bottom. Prick dough all over with a fork. Arrange mozzarella cheese slices over dough; cover with 1 cup sauce. Sprinkle Pecorino Romano cheese on top. Drizzle remaining olive oil over pizza.</li>
                <li>Let pizza rise in a warm area until puffy, about 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Bake pizza on the center rack of the preheated oven until edges are very dark brown but top is not burnt, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes before slicing into squares.</li>
            </ol>
