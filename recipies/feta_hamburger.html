        <p class="p">The classic american Burger can still have variations that are arguably better than the original</p>
        <p class="p">The genius of the Feta Burger comes from it's simplicity, instead of purtting the cheese on top of the patty, why not put it inside the patty? it's so simple but so effective, just talking about it get's me excited to make this so let's get to it!</p>

        
        <h2> <strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li> 1 pound lean ground beef </li>
            <li> Â½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce  </li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon dried parsley  </li>
            <li> salt and pepper to taste  </li>
            <li> 1 cup crumbled feta cheese </li>
        </ul>
    
        
        
        
        
        <h2 >Recipie</h2>
        <ol class="rec">
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Knead together the ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, parsley, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Form the mixture into 8 equal-sized balls; flatten to make thin patties. Place about 1/4 cup of feta cheese onto each of four of the patties. Top each of the patties with cheese with one of the patties without; press the edges together to seal the cheese into the center.</li>
            <li>Cook on the preheated grill until the burgers are cooked to your desired degree of doneness, 7 to 8 minutes per side for well done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="p">And now you're done again!! nice job and enjoy that well deserved burger!</p>
